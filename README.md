# eatThis
Final project app for CSC184 Mobile app programming

This app uses flutter and dart, and it aims to recommend food to eat based on what the user has eaten during the day and the user's physical information (gender and age); however, due to time constraints, the app currently recommends 5 random foods to the user. The app serves more of a demonstration for the app structure I did. 

4 screens were made: user sign in page, user physical info page, page for user to input food they have eaten, and lastly the recommended food page. The app used flutter and dart and firebase to implement user authentication. The user login page is implemented using firebase; for simplicity, basic email sign-up was provided. Since firebase provides more options, hopefully it would be easier to implement more sign in methods later if I intend to further work on the app. 

Please see further information in the presentation pdf file and the demo screenshots folder.
